# PHP Basic Auth

In many instances, the Require Login component of Altis is sufficient to block access to websites. However, sometimes, it's desirable to be able to test elements -- particularly on development environments -- as a logged-out user. In these cases, the Require Login module does not solve the problem and another method of blocking access is required. That's where PHP Basic Auth comes in.

PHP Basic Auth allows an engineering team to restrict access to a site using basic PHP authentication. On first load, the website will request a username and password -- if they are not passed, or the wrong username and password are provided, the site will not load.

**Note:** The authentication username and password _must_ be defined or basic authentication will not be active.

## Configuration

By default, PHP Basic Auth is disabled. To enable it, a value must be passed to `security.php-basic-auth` -- either `true` or an array that includes a username and password.

### Basic

The basic setup involves a simpler configuration in your `composer.json` but an additional step in the setup. Your Composer file would look like this:

```json
"altis": {
	"modules": {
		"security": {
			"php-basic-auth": true
		}
	}
}
```

This _turns on_ the PHP Basic Auth component, but does not define the username and password. Without the username and password, basic authentication will not be required. To specify the username and password in this configuration, you must add them as PHP constants to a `.config/constants.php` file. The following example is recommended:

```php
if ( in_array( \Altis\get_environment_type(), [ 'staging', 'development' ] ) {
	define( 'HM_BASIC_AUTH_USER', 'altisusername' );
	define( 'HM_BASIC_AUTH_PW', 'altispassword' );
}
```

### Advanced

The more advanced (and recommended) setup is a more complex `composer.json` file, but does not require defining the username and password constants in a separate file -- that's handled in the composer file itself. The same configuration in the above example can be handled like this in the Composer file:

```json
"altis": {
	"modules": {
		"php-basic-auth": {
			"username": "altisusername",
			"password": "altispassword"
		}
	}
}
```

## Overrides

By default, PHP Basic Auth will work on development and staging environments but not local or production environments. These defaults can be overridden in the `composer.json` file as well, or environment-specific username/password combinations could be defined:

```json
"altis": {
	"modules": {
		"security": {
			"php-basic-auth": {
				"username": "devuser",
				"password": "devpass"
			}
		}
	}
	"environments": {
		"local": {
			"modules": {
				"security": {
					"php-basic-auth": {
						"username": "altis",
						"password": "altis"
					}
				}
			}
		},
		"production": {
			"modules": {
				"security": {
					"php-basic-auth": {
						"username": "produser",
						"password": "prodpass"
					}
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```
